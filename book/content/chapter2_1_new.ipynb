    "# The Hyperbolic setting\n",

    "\n",
    "Invariant sets (see Definition \\ref{def:invset}) play a fundamental role in dynamical systems theory. In particular, they cannot be ``crossed’’ by trajectories and therefore they play a role in determining the possibilities for how trajectories may navigate phase space, i.e. phase space transport. Invariant sets can be characterized by their stability properties. Further, these can be divided into stability characteristics normal to the invariant set and tangential to the invariant set. The normal stability properties indicate how trajectories near, but not contained in, the invariant set behave.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally hyperbolic invariant sets play a particularly important role in phase space transport, particularly when the invariant set has the additional property of being an invariant manifold. For our purposes the reader can think of an invariant manifold as being a generalization of a curve or surface for which  the equation defining such a mathematical object is differentiable {cite}`guillemin2010differential`.  _Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds_ (NHIMs) have invariant stable and unstable manifolds that form the skeleton or framework,  on which phase space transport  occurs. But before we discuss normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in general, we discuss the simplest type of non-trivial type of normally hyperbolic invariant manifold—a hyperbolic periodic orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstable periodic orbits play an important role in our understanding of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Periodic orbits have constant energy, as well as their stable and unstable manifolds, and are contained in the energy surface that is of one less dimension than the dimension of the phase space, i.e. the energy surface has codimension one. In general, the codimension of a surface contained in phase space is the dimension of phase space minus the dimension of the surface. If the  codimension is one then it may divide the ambient space, and therefore  act as a barrier to transport in the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems a one dimensional unstable periodic orbits has two dimensional stable and unstable manifolds that can _\"divide\"_ the energy surface and can be used to create invariant regions (_\"lobes\"_)  that transport throughout the phase space, while respecting the _\"barrier nature\"_ of invariant manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than two degrees-of-freedom periodic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds do not have sufficient dimension (or, equivalently, their codimension is greater than one) to form barriers to transport or lobes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also note (cf. Section \\ref{sec:LDs}) the global phase space structure can be studied by creating a mapping along trajectories from a surface transverse to the flow in the energy surface, i.e. the Poincar\\'e map and the Poincar\\'e section. For two degrees-of-freedom the Poincar\\'e section is two dimensional. For $n$ degrees-of-freedom the Poincar\\'e section is $2n-2$ dimensional. The dynamics in the Poincar\\'e section is not easy to visualize for more than two degrees-of-freedom.\n",

    "NHIMs are a generalization of unstable periodic orbits to more than two degrees-of-freedom in this sense that they _may_ have stable and unstable manifolds of codimension one in the energy surface and, hence, for the framework on which phase space transport occurs  in Hamiltonian systems with more than two degrees-of-freedom {cite}`wiggins1990geometry`.  Now we want to develop this idea of a NHIM, and its consequences, in more detail. Recent references for this topic are {cite}`Wigginsbook1994,Wiggins2001,Wigginsbook2004,Eldering2013`, but we will begin with an elementary description.\n",

    "* A set in the constant energy level set is called _invariant_ under the flow if any trajectory in the set is contained in the set at all times (link to definition in previous chapter).\n",
    "* _Normal hyperbolicity_ means that locally under the linearized dynamics, the growth and decay rates in the normal directions to the manifold dominate the growth and decay rates tangent to it. These growth rates are quantified by eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the linearization for equilibria, Floquet exponents for the monodromy matrix associated with periodic orbits, and generalized Lyapunov exponents for more general invariant manifolds {cite}`Fenichel1971`.\n",

The dimension of the sphere depends on the number of degrees of freedom with non-zero energy. This sphere is a manifold, it is invariant and normally hyperbolic, hence a NHIM. In general a NHIM does not have to be a sphere. If all degrees of freedom have non-zero energy, except for $q_1,p_1=0$, the NHIM is $2n-3$ dimensional and its stable and unstable manifolds are dynamical barriers on the energy level set according to Tab. \\ref{tab:dimensions}.\n",
