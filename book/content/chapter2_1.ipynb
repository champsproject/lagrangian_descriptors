    "# The Hyperbolic setting\n",

    "Invariant sets (see Definition \\ref{def:invset}) play a fundamental role in dynamical systems theory. In particular, they cannot be ``crossed’’ by trajectories and therefore they play a role in determining the possibilities for how trajectories may navigate phase space, i.e. phase space transport. Invariant sets can be characterized by their stability properties. Further, these can be divided into stability characteristics normal to the invariant set and tangential to the invariant set. The normal stability properties indicate how trajectories near, but not contained in, the invariant set behave.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally hyperbolic invariant sets play a particularly important role in phase space transport, particularly when the invariant set has the additional property of being an invariant manifold. For our purposes the reader can think of an invariant manifold as being a generalization of a curve or surface for which  the equation defining such a mathematical object is differentiable \\cite{guillemin2010differential}.  _Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds_ (NHIMs) have invariant stable and unstable manifolds that form the skeleton or framework,  on which phase space transport  occurs. But before we discuss normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in general, we discuss the simplest type of non-trivial type of normally hyperbolic invariant manifold—a hyperbolic periodic orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstable periodic orbits play an important role in our understanding of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Periodic orbits have constant energy, as well as their stable and unstable manifolds, and are contained in the energy surface that is of one less dimension than the dimension of the phase space, i.e. the energy surface has codimension one. In general, the codimension of a surface contained in phase space is the dimension of phase space minus the dimension of the surface. If the  codimension is one then it may divide the ambient space, and therefore  act as a barrier to transport in the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems a one dimensional unstable periodic orbits has two dimensional stable and unstable manifolds that can _\"divide\"_ the energy surface and can be used to create invariant regions (_\"lobes\"_)  that transport throughout the phase space, while respecting the _\"barrier nature\"_ of invariant manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than two degrees-of-freedom periodic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds do not have sufficient dimension (or, equivalently, their codimension is greater than one) to form barriers to transport or lobes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also note (cf. Section \\ref{sec:LDs}) the global phase space structure can be studied by creating a mapping along trajectories from a surface transverse to the flow in the energy surface, i.e. the Poincar\\'e map and the Poincar\\'e section. For two degrees-of-freedom the Poincar\\'e section is two dimensional. For $n$ degrees-of-freedom the Poincar\\'e section is $2n-2$ dimensional. The dynamics in the Poincar\\'e section is not easy to visualize for more than two degrees-of-freedom.\n",

    "which is a periodic orbit for each $E > 0$. It is instructive to count the dimensions for intersecting sets. The phase space is four dimensional, the energy surface is three dimensional, and $q_1 = p_1 =0$ is two dimensional. A three dimensional surface intersects a two dimensional surface in a four dimensional space in a one dimensional set, which is the periodic orbit \\eqref{eq:LST4}. This family of periodic orbits (``family'' in terms of the energy $E>0$, lies on the two dimensional invariant manifold $q_1 = p_1 =0$. This is the Lyapunov subcenter manifold. Note that the Lyapunov subcenter manifold is {\\em not} isoenergetic. Each periodic orbit has a different energy, monotonically increasing from zero, which is the energy of the index one saddle point.\n",

    "The Lyapunov subcenter theorem says that this result holds, for sufficiently small $E > 0$, if higher  order terms are added to \\eqref{eq:LST1}. All of these  periodic orbits are unstable since the dynamics normal to the Lyapunov subcenter manifold is exponentially growing and decaying, i.e. the Lyapunov subcenter manifold is a NHIM.\n",
