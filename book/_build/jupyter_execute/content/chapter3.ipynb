    "# The Method of Lagrangian Descriptors\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\\label{sec:LDs}\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges of dynamical systems theory or nonlinear dynamics is the development of mathematical techniques that provide us with the capability of exploring  transport in phase space. Since the early 1900, the idea of pursuing a qualitative description of the solutions of differential equations, which emerged from the pioneering work carried out by Henri Poincar\\'e on the three body problem of celestial mechanics {cite}`hp1890`, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the nonlinear character of natural phenomena. The qualitative theory of dynamical systems has now been widely embraced by the scientific community. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to describe the details behind the method of Lagrangian descriptors. This simple and powerful technique unveils regions with qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior, the boundaries of which consist of invariant manifolds. In a procedure that is best characterised as \\textit{phase space tomography}, we can use low-dimensional slices we are able to completely reconstruct the intricate geometry of underlying invariant manifolds that governs phase space transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a general time-dependent dynamical system given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},t) \\;,\\quad \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\;,\\; t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\;,\n",
    "\\label{eq:gtp_dynSys}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the vector field $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is assumed to be sufficiently smooth both in space and time. The vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ can be prescribed by an analytical model or given from numerical simulations as a discrete spatio-temporal data set. For instance, the vector field could represent the velocity field of oceanic or atmospheric currents obtained from satellite measurements or from the numerical solution of geophysical models. In the context of chemical reaction dynamics, the vector field could be the result of molecular dynamics simulations. For any initial condition $\\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0$, the system of first order nonlinear differential equations given in Eq. \\eqref{eq:gtp_dynSys} has a unique solution represented by the trajectory that starts from that initial point $\\mathbf{x}_0$ at time $t_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the information that determines the behavior and fate of the trajectories for the dynamical system is encoded in the initial conditions (ICs) from which they are generated, we are interested in the development of a mathematical technique with the capability of revealing the underlying geometrical structures that govern the transport in phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) provide us with a simple and effective way of addressing this challenging task, because it is formulated as a scalar trajectory-diagnostic tool based on trajectories. The elegant idea behind this methodology is that it assigns to each initial condition selected in the phase space a positive number, which is calculated by accumulating the values taken by a predefined positive function along the trajectory when the system is evolved forward and backward for some time interval. The positive function of the phase space variables that is used to define different types of LD might have some geometrical or physical relevance, but this is not a necessary requirement for the implementation of the method. This approach is remarkably similar to the visualization techniques used in laboratory experiments to uncover the beautiful patterns of fluid flow structures with the help of drops of dye injected into the moving fluid {cite}`chien1986`. In fact, the development of LDs was originally inspired by the desire to explain the intricate geometrical flow patterns that are responsible for governing transport and mixing processes in Geophysical flows. The method was first introduced a decade ago based on the arclength of fluid parcel trajectories {cite}`madrid2009,mendoza2010`. Regions displaying qualitatively distinct dynamics will frequently contain trajectories with distinct arclengths and a large variation of the arclength indicate the presence of separatrices consisting of invariant manifolds {cite}`mancho2013lagrangian`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian descriptors have advantages in comparison with other methodologies for the exploration of phase space structures. A notable advantage is that they are straightforward to implement. \n",
    "Since its proposal as a nonlinear dynamics tool to explore phase space, this technique has found a myriad of applications in different scientific areas. For instance, it has been used in oceanography to plan transoceanic autonomous underwater vehicle missions by taking advantage of the underlying dynamical structure of ocean currents {cite}`ramos2018`. Also, it has been shown to provide relevant information for the effective management of marine oil spills {cite}`gg2016`. LDs have been used to analyze the structure of the Stratospheric Polar Vortex and its relation to sudden stratospheric warmings and also to ozone hole formation {cite}`alvaro1,alvaro2,curbelo2019a,curbelo2019b`. In all these problems, the vector field defining the dynamical system is a discrete spatio-temporal dataset obtained from the numerical simulation of geophysical models. Recently, this tool has also received recognition in the field of chemistry, for instance in transition state theory {cite}`craven2015lagrangian,craven2016deconstructing,craven2017lagrangian,revuelta2019unveiling`, where the computation of chemical reaction rates relies on the know\\-ledge of the phase space structures. These high-dimensional structures characterizing reaction dynamics are typically related to Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifolds (NHIMs) and their stable and unstable manifolds that occur in Hamiltonian systems. Other applications of LDs to chemical problems include the analysis of isomerization reactions {cite}`naik2020,GG2020b`, roaming {cite}`krajnak2019,gonzalez2020`, the study of the influence of bifurcations on the manifolds that control chemical reactions {cite}`GG2020a`, and also the explanation of the dynamical matching mechanism in terms of the existence of heteroclinic connections in a Hamiltonian system defined by Caldera-type potential energy surfaces {cite}`katsanikas2020a`.\n",

    "### Lagrangian Descriptors versus Poincar\\'e Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Poincar\\'e maps have been a standard and traditional technique for understanding the global phase space structure of dynamical systems. However,  Lagrangian descriptors offer substantial advantages over Poincar\\'e maps. We will describe these advantages in the context of the most common settings in which they are applied. However, we note that Lagrangian descriptors can be applied in exactly the same way to both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian vector fields. In keeping with the spirit of this book, we will frame our discussion and description in the Hamiltonian setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autonomous Hamiltonian vector fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The consideration of the dimension of different geometric objects is crucial to understanding the advantages of Lagrangian descriptors over Poincar\\'e maps. Therefore we will first consider the \"simplest\" situation in which these arise — the autonomous Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system is described by a four dimensional phase space described by coordinates $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$. Moreover, we have seen in  Section REF that trajectories are restricted to a three dimensional energy surface (\"energy conservation in autonomous Hamiltonian systems\"). We choose a two dimensional surface within the energy surface that is transverse to the Hamiltonian vector field. This means that at no point on the two dimensional surface is the Hamiltonian vector field tangent  to the surface and that at every point on the surface the Hamiltonian vector field has the same directional sense (this is defined more precisely in REF). This two dimensional surface is referred to as a  surface of section (SOS) or a Poincar\\'e section, and it is the domain of the Poincar\\'e map. The image of a point under the Poincar\\'e map is the point on the trajectory, starting from that point, that first returns to the surface (and this leads to the fact that the Poincar\\'e map is sometimes referred to as a \"first return map\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The practical implementation of this procedure gives rise to several questions. Given a specific two degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system can we find a two dimensional surface in the three dimensional energy surface having the property that it is transverse to the Hamiltonian vector field and \"most\" trajectories with initial conditions on the surface return to the surface? In general, the answer is \"no\" (unless we have some useful a priori knowledge of the phase space structure of the system). The advantage of the method of Lagrangian descriptors is that none of these features are required for its implementation, and it gives essentially the same information as Poincar\\'e maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the real advantage comes in considering higher dimensions, e.g autonomous Hamiltonian systems with more than two degrees-of-freedom. For definiteness, we will consider a three degree-of-freedom autonomous Hamiltonian system. In this case the phase space is six dimensional and  the energy surface is five dimensional. A cross section to the energy surface, in the sense described above, would be four dimensional (if an appropriate cross-section could be found). Solely on dimensionality considerations, we can see the difficulty. Choosing \"enough\" initial conditions on this four dimensional surface so that we can determine the phase space structures that are mapped out by the points that return to the cross-section is \"non-trivial\" (to say the least), and the situation only gets more difficult when we go to more than three degrees-of-freedom. One might imagine that you could start by considering lower dimensional subsets of the cross section. However, the probability that a trajectory would return to a lower dimensional subset is zero. Examples where Lagrangian descriptors have been used to analyse phase space structures in two and three degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems with this approach are given in {cite}`demian2017,naik2019a,naik2019b,GG2019`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian descriptors avoid all of these difficulties. In particular, they can be computed on any subset of the phase space since there is no requirement for trajectories to return to that subset. Since phase space structure is encoded in the initial conditions (not the final state) of  trajectories a dense grid of initial conditions can be placed on any subset of the phase space and a \"Lagrangian descriptor field\" can be computed for that subset with high resolution and accuracy. Such computations are generally not possible using the Poincar\\'e map approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonautonomous Hamiltonian vector fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonautonomous vector fields are fundamentally different than autonomous vector fields, and even more so for Hamiltonian vector fields. For example, one degree-of-freedom autonomous Hamiltonian vector fields are integrable. One degree-of-freedom autonomous Hamiltonian vector fields may exhibit chaos. Regardless of the dimension, a very significant difference is that energy is not conserved for nonautonomous Hamiltonian vector fields. Nevertheless, Lagrangian descriptors can be applied in exactly the same way as for autonomous Hamiltonian vector fields, _regardless of the nature of the time dependence. We add this last remark since the concept of Poincare maps  is not applicable unless the time dependence is periodic_"

    "### The Arclength Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build some intuition on how the method works and understand its very simple and straightforward implementation, we start with the arclength definition mentioned in the previous section. This version of LDs is also known in the literature as function $M$. Consider any region of the phase space where one would like to reveal structures at time $t = t_0$, and create a uniformly-spaced grid of ICs $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{x}(t_0)$ on it. Select a fixed integration time $\\tau$ that will be used to evolve all the trajectories generated from these ICs forward and backward in time for the time intervals $[t_0,t_0+\\tau]$ and $[t_0-\\tau,t_0]$ respectively. This covers a temporal range of $2\\tau$ centered at $t = t_0$, marking the time at which we want to take a snapshot of the underlying structures in phase space. The arclength of a trajectory in forward time can be easily calculated by solving he integral:\n",
    "\n",

    "We know that this dynamical system has a hyperbolic equilibrium point at the origin and that its stable and unstable invariant manifolds correspond to the lines $p = \\pm q$ respectively (refer to hyperbolic section). Outside of these lines, the trajectories are hyperbolas. What happens when we apply LDs to this system? Why does the method pick up the manifolds? Notice first that in Fig. \\ref{fig:1d_saddle} the value attained by LDs at the origin is zero, because it is an equilibrium point and hence it is not moving. Therefore, the arclength of its trajectory is zero. Next, let's consider the forward time evolution term of LDs, that is, $\\mathcal{L}^f$. Take two neighboring ICs, one lying on the line that corresponds to the stable manifold and another slightly off it. If we integrate them for a time $\\tau$, the initial condition that is on the manifold converges to the origin, while the other initial condition follows the arc of a hyperbola. If $\\tau$ is small, both segments of trajectory are comparable in length, so that the value obtained from LDs for both ICs is almost equal. However, if we integrate the system for a larger $\\tau$, the arclengths of the two trajectories become very different, because one converges while the other one diverges. Therefore, we can clearly see  in Fig. \\ref{fig:1d_saddle} that the LD values vary significantly near the stable manifold in comparison to those elsewhere. Moreover, if we consider a curve of initial conditions that crosses transversely the stable manifold, the LD value along it attains a minimum on the manifold. Notice also that by the same argument we gave above, but constructing the backward time evolution term of LDs, $\\mathcal{L}^b$, we can arrive to the conclusion that backward integration of initial conditions will highlight the unstable manifold of the hyperbolic equilibrium point at the origin. It is important to remark here that, although we have used above the simple linear saddle system as an example to illustrate how the method recovers phase space structure, this argument also applies to a nonlinear system with an hyperbolic point, whose stable and unstable manifolds are convoluted curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sharp transitions obtained for the LD values across the stable and unstable manifolds, which imply large values of its gradient in the vicinity of them, are known in the literature as \"singular features\". These features present in the LD scalar field are very easy to visualize and detect when plotting the output provided by the method. We will see shortly that there exists a rigorous mathematical connection between the \"singular features\" displayed by the LD output and the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points. This result was first proved in {cite}`lopesino2017` for two-dimensional flows, it was extended to 3D dynamical systems in {cite}`gg2018`, and it has also been recently established for the stable and unstable manifolds of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in Hamiltonian systems with two or more degrees of freedom in {cite}`demian2017,naik2019a`. In fact, the derivation of this relationship relies on an alternative definition for LDs, where the positive scalar function accumulated along the trajectories of the system is the $p$-norm of the vector field that determines the flow. Considering this approach, the LD scalar field becomes now non-differentiable at the phase space points that belong to a stable or unstable manifold, and consequently the gradient at these locations is unbounded. This property is crucial in many ways, since it allows us to easily recover the location of the stable and unstable manifolds in the LD plot as if they were the edges of objects that appear in a digital photograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key aspect that needs to be accounted for when setting up LDs for revealing the invariant manifolds in phase space, is the crucial role that the integration time $\\tau$ plays in the definition of the method itself. It is very important to appreciate this point, since $\\tau$ is the parameter responsible for controlling the complexity and intricate geometry of the phase space structures revealed in the scalar field displayed from the LD computation. A natural consequence of increasing the value for $\\tau$ is that richer details of the underlying structures are unveiled, since this implies that we are incorporating more information about the past and future dynamical history of trajectories in the computation of LDs. This means that $\\tau$ in some sense is intimately related to the time scales of the dynamical phenomena that occur in the model under consideration. This connection makes the integration time a problem-dependent parameter, and hence, there is no general \"golden rule\" for selecting its value for exploring phase space. Consequently, it is usually selected from the dynamical information obtained by performing beforehand several numerical experiments, and one needs to bear in mind the compromise that exists between the complexity of the structures revealed by the method to explain a certain dynamical mechanism, and the interpretation of the intricate manifolds displayed in the LD scalar output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish this part on the arclength definition of LDs we show that the method is also capable of revealing other invariant sets in phase space such as KAM tori, by means of studying the convergence of the time averages of LDs. We illustrate this property with the 1 DoF linear Hamiltonian with a center equilibrium at the origin:\n",

    "From the definition of the Hamiltonian we can see that the solutions to this system form a family of concentric circles about the origin with radius $R = \\sqrt{2H/\\omega}$. Moreover, each of this circles encloses an area of $A(H) = 2\\pi H / \\omega$. Using the definition of the Hamiltonian and the information provided by Hamilton's equations of motion we can easily evaluate the arclength LD for this system:\n",

    "\n",
    "where the initial condition $(q_0,p_0)$ has energy $H = H_0$ and therefore it lies on a circular trajectory with radius $\\sqrt{2H_0/\\omega}$. Hence, in this case all trajectories constructed from initial conditions on that circle share the same LD value. Moreover, if we consider the convergence of the time average of LD, this yields:\n",

    "\\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\langle \\, \\mathcal{L}(\\tau)  \\, \\rangle = \\dfrac{1}{2\\tau} \\int^{\\tau}_{-\\tau} \\sqrt{\\left(\\dot{q}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dot{p}\\right)^2} \\; dt = \\sqrt{2 \\omega H_0} = \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}\n",

For example, it allows for a rigorous analysis of the notion of \"singular features\" and to establish the mathematical connection of this notion to stable and unstable invariant manifolds in phase space. Another important aspect of the $p$-norm of LDs is that, since in the definition all the vector field components contribute separately, one can naturally decompose the LD in a way that allows to isolate individual degrees of freedom. This was used in \\cite {demian2017,naik2019a} to show that the method can be used to successfully detect NHIMs and their stable and unstable manifolds in Hamiltonian systems. Using the $p-$norm definition, it has been shown that the points on the LD contour map with non-differentiability identifies the invariant manifolds' intersections with the section on which the LD is computed, for specific systems ~{cite}`lopesino2017,demian2017,naik2019a`.

    "## Variable Integration Time Lagrangian Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we would like to discuss the issues that might arise from the definitions of LDs provided in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:M_function} and \\eqref{eq:Mp_function} when they are applied to analyze the dynamics in open Hamiltonian systems, that is, those for which phase space dynamics occurs in unbounded energy hypersurfaces. Notice that in both definitions, all the initial conditions considered by the method are integrated forward and backward for the same time $\\tau$. Recent studies have revealed  {cite}`junginger2017chemical,naik2019b,GG2020a` issues with trajectories that escape to infinity in finite time or at an increasing rate. The trajectories that show this behavior will give NaN (not-a-number) values in the LD scalar field, hiding some regions of the phase space, and therefore obscuring the detection of invariant manifolds. In order to circumvent this problem we explain here the approach that has been recently adopted in the literature {cite}`junginger2017chemical,naik2019b,GG2020a` known as variable integration time Lagrangian descriptors. In this methodology, LDs at any initial condition are calculated for a fixed initial integration time $\\tau_0$ or until the trajectory corresponding to that initial condition leaves a certain phase space region $\\mathcal{R}$ that we call the {\\em interaction region}, whichever happens first. Therefore the total integration time depends on the initial conditions, that is $\\tau(\\mathbf{x}_0)$. In this variable-time formulation, given a fixed integration time $\\tau_0 > 0$, the $p$-norm definition of LDs with $p \\in (0,1]$ will take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_p(\\mathbf{x}_{0},t_0,\\tau_0) = \\int^{t_0 + \\tau^{+}_{\\mathbf{x}_0}}_{t_0 - \\tau^{-}_{\\mathbf{x}_0}} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |f_{k}(\\mathbf{x}(t;\\mathbf{x}_0),t)|^p \\; dt  = \\mathcal{L}^{f}_p(\\mathbf{x}_{0},t_0,\\tau) + \\mathcal{L}^{b}_p(\\mathbf{x}_{0},t_0,\\tau)\n",
    "\\label{eq:Mp_vt}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the total integration time used for each initial condition is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\tau^{\\pm}_{\\mathbf{x}_{0}}(\\tau_0,\\mathcal{R}) = \\min \\left\\lbrace \\tau_0 \\, , \\, |t^{\\pm}| \\right\\rbrace \\; ,\n",

    "\n",
    "and $t^{+}$, $t^{-}$ represent the times for which the trajectory leaves the interaction region $\\mathcal{R}$ in forward and backward time respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to highlight that the variable time integration LD has also the capability of capturing the locations of the stable and unstable manifolds present in the phase space slice used for the computation, and it will do so at points where the LD values vary significantly. Moreover, KAM tori will also be detected by the contour values of the time-averaged LD. Therefore, the variable integration time LDs provides us with a suitable methodology to study the phase space structures that characterize escaping dynamics in open Hamiltonians, since it avoids the issue of trajectories escaping to infinity very fast. It is important to remark here that this alternative approach for computing LDs can be adapted to other definitions of the method, where a different positive and bounded function is integrated along the trajectories of the dynamical system. For example, going back to the arclength definition of LDs, the variable  integration time strategy would yield the formulation:\n",

    "We begin by computing LDs for the unforced Duffing system using $\\tau = 2$. For this small integration time, the method highlights the saddle and center fixed points, since the arclength at those points is always zero. In this case the phase portrait looks blurry as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:duffing1_lds} A), and this is a consequence of trajectories not being sufficiently dynamically distinct by the end of the integration interval. If we increase the integration time to $\\tau = 10$, we can see in Fig. \\ref{fig:duffing1_lds} B) that the homoclinic connection formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at the origin becomes clearly visible. Moreover, observe that the manifolds are located at points where the scalar values taken by LDs change abruptly. This property is demonstrated in Fig. \\ref{fig:duffing1_lds} C), where we have depicted the value of function $M$ along the line $y = 0.5$. Notice that sharp changes in the scalar field of LDs at the manifolds are also related to local minima."

The result obtained when the LDs values are plotted will reveal the stable and unstable manifolds and also KAM tori in the surface of section under consideration. Since the stable and unstable manifolds are detected at points where the LD scalar function is non-differentiable, we can directly extract them from the gradient, that is, using $||\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_p||$. We begin by looking at the phase space structures on the SOS $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{y,p_y}$. To do so, we fix an energy for the system $H = 1/12$, which is below that of the saddle-center equilibrium points. For that energy level, the exit channels of the PES are closed, and therefore, all trajectories are trapped in the scattering region of the central minimum at the origin. We can clearly see in Fig. \\ref{fig:henonHeiles_lds} A)-B) that the computation of the $p$-norm variable integration time LDs with $p = 1/2$ using $\\tau = 50$ reveals that the motion of the system is completely regular. The method nicely captures the UPO present in the central region of the PES and also its stable and unstable manifolds which form a homoclininc connection. In order to demonstrate how the intricate details of chaotic motion are captured by LDs, we increase the energy of the system to $H = 1/3$. This energy level is now above that of the index-1 saddles of the PES, and consequently, phase space bottlenecks open in the energy manifold allowing trajectories of the system to escape to infinity from the scattering region. When we apply LDs using $\\tau = 10$ on the SOSs defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:psos}, we observe in Figs. \\ref{fig:henonHeiles_lds} C)-F) that we can detect with high-fidelity the intricate homoclinic tangle formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the UPO associated to the upper index-1 saddle of the PES. Moreover, observe that despite the issue of trajectories escaping to infinity in finite time, LDs succeed in revealing the template of geometrical phase space structures that governs transport and escape dynamics from the PES of the H\\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian system."

This last mapping is obtained from linearizing the original RDS $\\varphi$ over the stationary orbit $(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y})$. This result serves as an argument to denote $\\mathcal{S}(\\omega )$ and $\\mathcal{U}(\\omega )$ as the stable and unstable manifolds of the stationary orbit, not only because these two subsets are invariant under $\\varphi$, as one can deduce from (\\ref{invariance_x}) and (\\ref{invariance_y}), but also due to the dynamical behaviour of their trajectories in a neighborhood of the stationary orbit $\\tilde{X}(\\omega )$. Hence the important  characteristic  of $\\tilde{X}(\\omega )=(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y})$ is not only its independence with respect to the time variable $t$; but also the fact  that it exhibits  hyperbolic behaviour with respect to its neighboring trajectories. Considering the hyperbolicity of a given solution, as well as in the deterministic context, means considering  the hyperbolicity of the RDS $\\varphi$ linearized over such solution. Specifically, the Oseledets' multiplicative ergodic theorem for random dynamical systems ({cite}`arno98` and {cite}`duan15`) ensures the existence of a Lyapunov spectrum which is necessary to determine whether the stationary orbit $\\tilde{X}(\\omega )$ is hyperbolic or not. All these issues are well reported in {cite}`duan15`, including the proof that the noisy saddle (\\ref{noisy_saddle}) satisfies the Oseledets' multiplicative ergodic theorem conditions.\n",

    "Before  implementing the numerical method of Lagrangian descriptors to several examples of SDEs, it is important to remark why random fixed points and their respective stable and unstable manifolds govern the nearby trajectories, and furthermore, how they may influence the dynamics throughout the rest of the domain. These are essential issues in order to describe the global phase space  motion of  solutions of SDEs. However, these questions do not have a simple answer. For instance, in the noisy saddle example (\\ref{noisy_saddle}) the geometrical structures arising from the dynamics generated around the stationary orbit are quite similar to the dynamics corresponding to the deterministic saddle point $\\lbrace \\dot{x}=x,\\dot{y}=-y \\rbrace$. Significantly, the manifolds $\\mathcal{S}(\\omega )$ and $\\mathcal{U}(\\omega )$ of the noisy saddle form two dynamical barriers for other trajectories in the same way that the manifolds $\\lbrace x = 0 \\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace y = 0 \\rbrace$ of the deterministic saddle work. This means that for any particular experiment, i.e., for any given $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, the manifolds $\\mathcal{S}(\\omega )$ and $\\mathcal{U}(\\omega )$ are determined and cannot be \"crossed\" by other trajectories due to the uniqueness of solutions (remember that the manifolds are invariant under the RDS (\\ref{noisy_saddle_RDS}) and are comprised of an infinite family of solutions). Also by considering the exponential separation rates reported in (\\ref{eq_1}) with the rest of trajectories, the manifolds $\\mathcal{S}(\\omega )$ and $\\mathcal{U}(\\omega )$ divide the plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of initial conditions into four qualitatively distinct dynamical regions; therefore providing a phase portrait representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless it remains to show that such analogy can be found between other SDEs and their corresponding non-noisy deterministic differential equations\\footnote{Otherwise if nonlinearity is dominating the behavior of the terms in equation (\\ref{SDE}) then the correspondence between the manifolds for $\\Phi (t, \\omega )$ to the manifolds for $\\varphi$ needs to be made by means of the local stable and unstable manifold theorem (see {cite}`moham99`, Theorem 3.1). Therein it is considered a homeomorphism $H(\\omega )$ which establishes the equivalence of the geometrical structures arising for both sets of manifolds, and as a consequence the manifolds for $\\varphi$ inherit the same dynamics as the ones for $\\Phi (t, \\omega )$ but only in a neighborhood of the stationary orbit. In this sense the existence of such manifolds for a nonlinear RDS $\\varphi$ is only ensured locally. Anyway this result provides a very good approximation to the stochastic dynamics of a system, and enables us to discuss the different patterns of behavior of the solutions in the following examples.}. In this direction there is a recent result ({cite}`cheng16`, Theorem 2.1) which ensures the equivalence in the dynamics of both kinds of equations when the noisy term $\\sigma$ is additive (i.e., $\\sigma$ does not depend on the solution $X_{t}$). Although this was done by means of the most probable phase portrait, a technique that closely resembles the ordinary phase space for deterministic systems, this fact might indicate that such analogy in the dynamics cannot be achieved when the noise does depend explicitly on the solution $X_{t}$. Actually any additive noise affects all the particles together at the same magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway the noisy saddle serves to establish an analogy to the dynamics with the deterministic saddle. One of its features is the contrast between the growth of the components $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$, which mainly have a positive and negative exponential growth respectively. We will see that this is graphically captured when applying the stochastic Lagrangian descriptors method to the SDE (\\ref{noisy_saddle}) over a domain of the stationary orbit. Moreover when representing the stochastic Lagrangian descriptor values for the noisy saddle, one can observe that the lowest values are precisely located on the manifolds $\\mathcal{S}(\\omega )$ and $\\mathcal{U}(\\omega )$. These are manifested as  sharp features indicating a rapid change of the values that the stochastic Lagrangian descriptor assumes. This geometrical structure formed by \"local minimums\" has a very marked crossed form and it is straightforward to think that the stationary orbit is located at the intersection of the two cross-sections. These statements are supported afterwards by numerical simulations and analytical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there persists an open question about how reliable the stochastic Lagrangian descriptors method is when trying to depict the phase space of an arbitrary stochastic differential equation. This is the main issue concerning this method and has only been partially reported for deterministic dynamical systems in previous articles ({cite}`mancho2013lagrangian` and {cite}`lopesino2017`). In this last paper it is analytically proven the efficacy of this method for autonomous and non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. The theoretical idea that supports this assertion is the discontinuity of the transversal derivative of the Lagrangian descriptor function over the manifolds of the corresponding hyperbolic trajectory. Following this idea, these \"singular features\" arising on the manifolds of a hyperbolic trajectory for a deterministic Hamiltonian system motivates  us to study whether the \"abrupt changes\" on the stochastic Lagrangian descriptor function represent the location of the manifolds of a stationary orbit or not. Another related question is to determine the size of the random term $\\sigma dW$ in relation to  its influence on  the phase space of the deterministic equation $dX = b dt$. The next sections will be dedicated to addressing  these  issues by considering concrete examples of SDEs."
